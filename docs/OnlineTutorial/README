Repast HPC Self-Guided Tutorial

Version 1.0.1-dev

by John T. Murphy
*******************************************************
This directory should contain, in addition to this
README file, two compressed files (tarballs) called
HTML and SRC. These contain:

   HTML: The full text of the guide, including
all instructions and explanations of each step
to be performed in building the tutorial examples
   SRC: Read-Only versions of the each step in
the tutorial examples

To use this guide, it is recommended that you:

1) Copy the HTML tarball to a local machine, expand
it, and open to the main.html page, from which you can
navigate through the tutorial as a website
2) Copy the SRC tarball to the machine on which you
will be compiling and running the Repast HPC code;
this may be the local machine or it may be a remote
machine on which you can run HPC code (i.e. a Blue
Gene system).
