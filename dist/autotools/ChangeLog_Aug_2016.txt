Changes since Repast HPC 2.1 (8 May 2015):

New features include:

N-Dimensional Spaces
	Shared discrete and continuous spaces can now be created in N-Dimensions. This allows 3-D simulations (and higher). All synchronization routines operate as in previous releases.

N-Dimensional Value Layers
	Value layers that store basic data (not agents) can now be created; indexing is identical to spatial coordinate systems. Synchronization uses fundamental MPI. A special version allows synchronous updating by providing two data banks.

Diffusion
	A new DiffusionLayerND class allows simple implementation of diffusion algoriths through N-Dimensional Value Layers. Users provide custom diffusion algorithms, while Repast HPC classes manage processing cells and synchronization across processes of results

Properties Writing
	Simulation can now write properties in a format that can be read as a properties file; useful for re-running runs.



Other Changes:

Bug Fix: Config Lexer omits rank when called during RepastProcess::init. Fixes a problem with error reporting during init.

Removed Swap X/Y from CartTopology: Removed unneeded swap of x and y dimensions

Bug Fix: Logger delete should have been delete[] (logger.cpp)

Bug Fix: Properties File Builder delete should have been delete[] (Properties.cpp)

Bug Fix: RepastProcess.cpp synchronization routines, delete should have been delete[] (RepastProcess.cpp)

Bug Fix: Logger in repast namespace (Logger.h, Logger.cpp)
