This is the README for Repast HPC 1.0.1 Final. 

0. Installation of Repast HPC can done be using the standard ./configure
script described in INSTALL or using the Makefile in the MANUAL_INSTALLATION
directory. On standard Unix and MacOS ./congfigure is preferred, but
on many HPC machines (e.g. Blue Gene) the custom Makefile may be easier.
See MANUAL_INSTALLATION/INSTALL.TXT for more info on using the custom
Makefile.

Reagardless of which installation method is chosen, Repast HPC has
the following prerequisites. 

1. An MPI implementation. Repast HPC was developed using OpenMPI, but
there are others to choose from. 

http://openmpi.org
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/ 

2. The boost libraries must be installed. Most of the boost
libraries are header only, but a few must be compiled. Of the compiled
ones, Repast HPC requires:

	- MPI
	- Serialization (which is required by MPI)
	- Filesystem
	- System

See the boost docs for how to compile these libraries.

http://www.boost.org

3. NetCDF C and C++ libraries

http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/

Installation using ./configure etc. will create and
install librepast_hpc* and librelogo in the appropriate
directory, as well as copying the header files.

The distribution contains a src directory which
contains source for two simple sample models:
zombies and rumor. As part of make, these will be
compiled and put into an examples_bin directory where
they can be run with:

mpirun -np 4 ./zombie_model config.props model.props
mpirun -np 6 ./rumor_model config.props model.props


Once compiled, see the Repast HPC manual in 
docs/repast_hpc_manual.pdf and the API documentation 
in docs/api/html/index.html to get started with 
writing your own Repast HPC simulations.
