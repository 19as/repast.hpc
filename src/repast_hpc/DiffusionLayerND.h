/**
 * The DiffusionLayerND class is an N-dimensional layer of
 * double values that can be used to diffuse through an N-D
 * space. Diffusion is a synchronous updating of cells
 * based on adjacent cells' values.
 *
 * The synchronous update is achieved through bank switching:
 * two separate grids are maintained, and at any time one of
 * them is 'active' and the other is obsolete and ready to
 * accept the next round of values.
 *
 * The most complex part of the DiffusionLayerND class is the
 * interaction with MPI. Cross-process synchronization requires
 * that blocks of cells (technically volumes in N-space) be
 * sent across processes. MPI Derived Datatypes are used
 * to achieve this.
 *
 * The memory for the N-Dimensional array is organized
 * as a nested loop. Assume that the dimensions for
 * the array are d1, d2, d3 ... dN. The extent of the grid
 * in each dimension is e1, e2, e3 ... eN. Note that this
 * includes both the space within the local boundaries
 * and the adjacent buffer zones. For convenience
 * we pre-calculate a vector M1, M2, M3 ... MN of multipliers; each
 * entry is equal to the product of all the extents of
 * lower-numbered dimensions, with M1 = 1. The address of a cell
 * a locations l1, l2, l3 ... lN will be:
 *
 *    l1 * M1 + l2 * M2 + l3 * M3 ... lN * MN
 *
 * A volume in this space will not occupy a contiguous
 * block of memory. It would be more convenient for the MPI
 * call if it did. However, the MPI specification indicates
 * that derived data types can be used to define complex
 * regions of memory; the MPI implementation can optimize
 * the sending and receiving of these.
 *
 * In this class, an MPI Datatype is defined to represent
 * the volume of space being sent to and received from
 * each of the 3N - 1 adjacent processes.
 *
 * One important note is that the send and receive data types
 * for a given exchange partner will be identical; only the
 * starting pointer need be changed to switch from sending
 * to receiving.
 *
 * (It should be noted that MPI allows these data types to
 * 'match' if they are structurally compatible. They need
 * not actually be identical. So, consider a send/receive
 * pair where one of the pair is against the global
 * simulation boundaries but the other is not. The actual
 * pattern of loops and steps that creates the send will
 * be different from the pattern that creates the receive,
 * but MPI will recognize that these are 'matchable' and
 * will perform the communication.)
 *
 * The data type can be defined recursively using MPI's
 * HVector function for all types except the innermost,
 * which is a contiguous block of double values.
