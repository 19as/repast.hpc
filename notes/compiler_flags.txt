The following compiler flags may be used when building RSCPP from source:

MS_LIBRARY: When set, functions that are not provided by Microsoft's version of C++
(as opposed to the GNU libraries, which are considered the native code for RSCPP)
are either ignored or substituted.

OMIT_NETCDF: The 'NetCDF' output format is supported by default, but can optionally
be omitted by defining this flag. When defined, all code related to NetCDF is ignored.
